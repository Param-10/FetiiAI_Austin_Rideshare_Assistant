### FetiiAI Rideshare Assistant Write-up

#### **1. What We Built**

We built an interactive, conversational AI assistant that provides insights into Fetii's rideshare data for the Austin, TX market. The assistant, powered by Google's Gemini Pro, can answer natural language questions about transportation patterns, popular locations, and rider demographics.

Key features include:
*   **Conversational AI:** Users can ask questions in plain English to get insights.
*   **Dynamic Visualizations:** The assistant generates dynamic charts and maps (e.g., "Trips Over Time", "Hourly Pickup Patterns", "Top Drop-off Locations") to visually represent the data.
*   **Modern, Minimalist UI:** A completely redesigned user interface with a "spectacular" dark-by-default theme and a light mode toggle for user preference. The layout is clean, centered, and fully responsive.
*   **Interactive Filters:** Users can filter the entire dataset by date range and group size to refine their queries.

We successfully addressed the initial bugs, including fixing a critical issue that prevented the "Trips Over Time" chart from loading and resolving layout problems that caused charts to be clipped.

#### **2. How It Works**

The application is built on a Python backend using several key technologies:

*   **Streamlit:** Powers the interactive web application and user interface.
*   **Pandas:** Used for all data loading, cleaning, and manipulation. The system robustly handles data from Excel or CSV files and performs significant feature engineering (e.g., calculating trip distances, costs, and time-based features).
*   **Plotly:** Creates the dynamic, interactive charts for data visualization.
*   **Gemini & LangChain:** The AI component uses a hybrid system for understanding user queries:
    1.  A fast, local, keyword-based classifier handles simple, common queries for speed and reliability.
    2.  For more complex or general questions, it leverages the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model to parse intent and extract specific entities (like locations, dates, and ages).
*   **Analytics Engine:** A custom analytics module processes the parsed query, filters the Pandas DataFrame accordingly, and generates the necessary data summaries and visualizations.

The new UI is implemented using custom CSS injected into Streamlit, allowing for fine-grained control over the visual appearance and enabling the seamless dark/light mode theme switching.

#### **3. What I'd Improve or Add Next**

While the core functionality is strong, there are several areas for future improvement:

*   **Improve Intent Detection:** During testing, we found that some nuanced queries were occasionally misclassified by the AI model. The current hybrid system is a good start, but fine-tuning the Gemini model with more examples or using a more advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach would improve the accuracy and robustness of the natural language understanding.
*   **More Advanced Analytics:** We could add more complex analytics, such as route optimization suggestions, demand forecasting based on historical trends, or A/B testing analysis for different service changes.
*   **User Accounts & History:** Allowing users to log in to save their query history and personalized filter settings would be a great addition.
*   **Performance Optimization:** For larger datasets, the Pandas operations could be optimized further using more efficient data storage formats like Parquet and more advanced query execution engines.
